If you have other idea - let us known. You can contact us on [Discord Channel my-aac](https://discord.gg/2J39Wus).

### Code Rules

We use [EditorConfig](https://github.com/otsoft/myaac/blob/master/.editorconfig) to force some rules, please follow them in your editor. You can find plugin for IDE of your choice here: https://editorconfig.org/#download

Except that, please follow some other rules:

* look how our PHP code is formatted, and do the same

### Is the contribution you want to do a template or page?

Then think about creating a separate plugin for MyAAC. You can then submit the code directly to [myaac-plugins](https://github.com/slawkens/myaac-plugins) repository. If it pass some requirements tests, it will be merged into the repository.
