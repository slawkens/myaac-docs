# Compatibility

Here's a list of biggest changes in structure and functions of MyAAC that may require you to define in your plugin manifest json file different minimal MyAAC version to be supported.

You can define the minimum version on which MyAAC plugin can be installed like this: (in your .json file)

```
"require": {
	"myaac": "0.4.3"
},
```

## Versions:

### v0.3.0

* added Twig template engine

### v0.4.0

* Automatically detect json file in .zip instead of basing on filename (admin panel - plugins installer)

> in this update your plugin json file doesn't need to have anymore the same name as .zipped file. Like my-plugin.zip, then plugin.json location should be plugins/my-plugin.json. From now you can use custom names like my-plugin.zip and plugins/another-name-for-this.json. We still however, advice you to use same name of plugin like the name of .zip file to support older MyAAC versions.

### v0.5.0

* moved .htaccess rules to plain php (index.php)

> This adds new addresses like /account/manage or /account/create

* added option to uninstall plugin
* added option to require specified myaac, php or database version for plugins, without that plugin won't be installed
* added admin panel custom links support - for future plugins. You can hook you menus on plugin install into `myaac_admin_menu` table

### v0.6.1

* new configurable: session\_prefix, to allow more websites on one machine (must be unique for every website on your dedicated server!

> You should be using now functions: getSession(key) and setSession(key, value) for dealing with user session data. This way session\_prefix will be automatically appended to the session name.

* added items.xml loader class and weapons.xml loader class, they're now saved in database, and you can use them in your plugin
